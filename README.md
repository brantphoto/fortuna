# FORTUNA

Fortuna is the client app for an unnamed javascript skills assessment forum I'm building as well as the Greek goddess of fortune.

### PURPOSE

Personal project built with Angular and Angular Material. This project is a work in progress.

### GOALS

Going for development speed and 'pureness' when it comes to using Angular Material 'components'
and using as much flexbox as possible in the layout. Of course, I'm sure I may have to make a couple
of directives here and there but in those cases I'm going to use inline styles where I can.

### NEXT?

After this I'll be cloning this app in React (consuming same back end)
so I'll be keeping this one simple so I can put time in both.
